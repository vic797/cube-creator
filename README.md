# Contribute

Cube Creator is in **Alpha** stage so many bugs are expected. If you encounter one make sure to open an issue. Also Cube Cretor needs an icon; if you create create one and share it that would be apreciated.

# Development

Cube Creator is written entirely in [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/), even the plugins. To modify Cube Creator is recomended to use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). 

If you want to create a plugin you can use Cube Creator itself. A detailed page with some useful information will be created soon.

If you want to create a custom version if this software make sure to use another name for it to avoid confution with the main release.
